## Dear grading peers:

I have finished code the programming assignment 2 for R-programming,
the code I modified was stored in the R file <cachematrix.R>, and 
I also add a test code in the end of the cachematrix file to test 
if the function works. 

As you can see from my code, if the inverseMatrix == newinverseMatrix
in every rows and columns, it says that the function has worked, the 
return inverse though usual way and though cache are the same. 
Because the return value of TRUE and False are stored in a matrix, I 
have it transfered into a list so we can minimize the loop we have to use.

So that's all, if you have any questions, you can reach me at 
"411102191@qq.com"
